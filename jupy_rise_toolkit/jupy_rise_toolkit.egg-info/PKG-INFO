# jupy_rise_toolkit

This package provides some useful quality-of-life tools making teaching with jupyter nootbook and RISE easier.


## Installation

Installation from [Test PyPi](https://test.pypi.org/):

```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ jupy_rise_toolkit
```

You can also install directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Stochastik-TU-Ilmenau/jupy_rise_toolkit.git
```

## Usage

### Hiding input of code cells in presentation

Execute `jupy_rise_toolkit.hide()` in a code cell to hide its input in presentation.

### Generating a template

We recommend using a `.css` file in the notebook's directory to set up a custom theme, as styling commands from the notebook might impact styling outside the presentation. However, the `create_template()` can be used to get a ready-to-use template. Executing
>create_template( author: str = 'Author', \
>        title: str = 'Titel', \
>        institution: str = 'Institution', \
>        date: str = 'DD MM YYYY', \
>        filename: str = 'my_notebook' )

will create a template file. The notebook automatically gets a footer with the jupyter logo ([source](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter.github.io/blob/master/assets/share.png); image and license are included in the pacakge data).

### Generating a PDF

Our pakcage offers two ways to obtain a PDF from a directory with at least one jupyter notebook. This is based on work from [Matthias Glock](https://github.com/matthias-g-) and modified code from [playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/).

We recommend executing the script from console:

>python -m jupy_rise_toolkit.ipynb2pdf

By default, this generates `html` files for all `ipynb.` files in current directory and prints them to `PDF` via [chromium](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects/).

Additional parameters are:

| parameter    | description |
| -------- | ------- |
| -no-input  | hide input cells with python code (displayed by default) |
| -hide-tag |   remove all input cells with cell tag `hide` (overwrites -no-input)                |
| -ex    |  re-execute notebooks (off by default; necessary for correct display of widgets)  |
| -no-overwrite | only convert notebooks that are not already converted                         (by default all notebooks are converted overwriting already existing files) |

We also provide a version that can be executed inside the notebook. However, on `Windows`, calling chromium from notebooks causes an error; hence, this function can currently only be used on `Linux`.

The function `ipynb2pdf_from_nb` first copies the current notebook (with all cells containing said funtion removed) and then executes the script above.

Using `nbconvert` from notebok works, but does not allow specifying PDF parameters.

### Setting up a survey with live analysis

To create a survey with possible live analysis (e.g., for a quizzes in classes), follow these steps:

1. Create a publicly available file in which the survey's answers are stored. This is possible with Google; we use the cloud infrastructure of our university.
2. Generate a download link for the file above. Often, adding `/download` to its weblink suffices.
3. Use `show_QR_code()` to show the link to the survey as a QR-code.
4. Download the file with `Pandas`.

## Dependencies

The package requires `python >= 3.9`.

The functions are written for classical jupyter notebook (version `6.4.8` was used during developement). Make sure to use a former version of `traitlets` (we use version `5.9.0`), as the current version is incompatible with said notebook versions. Regarding RISE, we used version `5.7.1`.
